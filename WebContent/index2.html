       Stories common to a particular culture,
       but not supported by external sources (such 
       as the tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as 
       cultural heritage or legends, because they do not show the "disinterested 
       investigation" required of the discipline of history.[10][11] Herodotus, a
       5th-century BC Greek historian is considered within the Western tradition to be
       the "father of history", and, along with his contemporary Thucydides, helped
       form the foundations for the modern study of human history. Their works continue 
       to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the
       military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern 
       historical writing. In East Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and 
       Autumn Annals was known to be compiled
       from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived.
       Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history
       which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today.
       The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study 
       of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical 
       elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part 
       of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is
       a major discipline in university studies
